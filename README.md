## What this is
A Stripe test project on how to use Stripe with Next.js.
This is bootstraped with examples for most of the core function (checkout, payment, customer portal, etc.)

For my own references and hopefully help other folks too. This is mostly a simple feature test and not reflective of how I would structure my project. 
For that, I would recommend https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

## Getting Started

You'll need a supabase account and a stripe account to get started.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
